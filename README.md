# SmartEstate Predictor

**SmartEstate Predictor** is a machine learning project designed to predict real estate prices using various regression models. The project focuses on preprocessing data, training models, evaluating their performance, and comparing results to identify the best-performing algorithm.

## Features
- Predict real estate prices based on input features.
- Implements and evaluates multiple machine learning models:
  - Decision Tree Regressor
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
- Compares model performance with mean scores and standard deviations.

## Files in the Repository
1. **data.csv**: Contains the dataset used for training and testing the models.
2. **Dragon Real Estate.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook with code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
3. **Dragon.joblib**: The saved model for reuse.
4. **Model_outputs.txt**: A summary of the model evaluation metrics.

## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib` (if visualization is included)

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ragztigadi/SmartEstate-Predictor.git
   cd SmartEstate-Predictor
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Ensure to create a `requirements.txt` with your project dependencies if not already done.)*

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the code step-by-step:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook "Dragon Real Estate.ipynb"
   ```

4. Use the `Dragon.joblib` model for predictions.

## Results
- **Decision Tree Regressor**: Mean score: `4.1221`, Std Dev: `0.8223`
- **Linear Regression**: Mean score: `4.2222`, Std Dev: `0.7520`
- **Random Forest Regressor**: Mean score: `3.3489`, Std Dev: `0.7606`

The **Random Forest Regressor** achieved the best performance with the lowest mean score.

## Future Work
- Experiment with additional features to improve model accuracy.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better performance.
- Deploy the best-performing model using a web framework (e.g., Flask or Django).
